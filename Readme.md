This Stuffed Cheesy Garlic Bread recipe is a copycat version of Dominos Stuffed Garlic bread which is homemade, creamy, cheesy garlic flavored bread recipe.

Today i have showed how to make Dominos style stuffed cheesy garlic bread ,but if you want to make only garlic bread sticks available in Dominos follow the same process and skip adding mayonnaise and sweet corn.
